# Lizzie Turney


Junior full-stack developer with an entrepreneurial flair for creating eye-catching web apps! I'm best described as a bubbly, carbonara-lover, who never falters from being optimistic. Friends and colleagues consider me to be a very strong communicator (except when the term "groovy" occasionally slips out). I have experience in front-end, back-end, test-driven and database technologies. I lean towards front-end design due to the scope of creativity it allows. However, I enjoy every aspect of a full-stack code base and embrace every opportunity to improve my skills.
