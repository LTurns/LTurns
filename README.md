<p align="center">
Junior full-stack developer with an entrepreneurial flair for creating eye-catching applications! I'm best described as a bubbly, carbonara-lover, who never falters from being optimistic. Friends and colleagues consider me to be a very strong communicator from my time in financial sales. I have experience in front-end, back-end, test-driven and database technologies. I lean towards front-end design due to the scope of creativity it allows. However, I enjoy every aspect of a full-stack codebase and embrace every opportunity to improve my skills.

 <p align="center">
Over the last few years, I have established wonderful jobs within finance. I thoroughly enjoyed working in this industry, and believe it taught me unparalelled levels of professionalism and fuelled my initial interest in technology. Since then, coding has opened my mind to how technology truly influences and alters every aspect of our lives. I'm throroughly excited to be part of where it goes next!

## Skills <a name="chapter-2"></a>

### **Communication:** ###

In my previous job, much of my time involved consulting with financial investors or investment managers over large amounts of money. This required a high-level of clarity and professionalism, something I can certainly bring to the table. Further to this, in sales, you learn to "mirror" your clients. Selling everyday, though immensely tough, taught me to tailor my approach to each individual, among other invaluable lessons. This stream of varied conversation was something I exceeded in, always hitting target and bringing in over £200k of revenue in my first year.

Technology is perhaps the most indispensable industry of our time. Therefore, being a strong communicator, someone to bridge the gap between client and developer, is perhaps more important than ever and will continue to be a growing necessity.

### **Hard Worker:** ###

Jumping from a "C" to an "A" for A level French, exceeding my predicted grades, County Squash Champion and Grade 8 Voice were some early examples of my ability to work and study hard. More recently, it has been proven in my professional career, such as when I received a large promotion from Commercial Executive to Major Accounts Executive at the age of 24.

Self-sufficiency has always been important to me. I wanted to do Makers Academy for over a year and was able to save and complete the course, all while paying rent and bills in London independently. When I come across a problem in my code, it will niggle me until I solve it. I find great satisfaction in seeing my hard work pay off, and technology is no exception. As someone who has worked in industries such as film, sales and finance, I know versatility and a strong work ethic, are essential.

### **Logical and Creative Thinker:** ###

When studying English Literature and Philosophy at University, one of the most useful subject matters was the study of Logic. This was my strongest subject throughout my time at University. I received honours for every paper. Deducting the correct arguments and using mathmatical approaches came to me far more naturally than I ever suspected; I am able to revisit this part of my mind when I code. It has also benefited my creative side. In my masters, I had to edit, create and compose sound for trailers (the trailer I created here was for a 4 minute film https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sukp6BQ7_dQ). Combining logic, analytics and creativity really seemed to ameliorate and strengthen my work.

The world is ever evolving due to technology. Creativity, entrepreneurship and logical thinking are at the forefront of this evolution, so having the mindset to get involved, stay ahead, and one day make your own venture, truly excites me.
