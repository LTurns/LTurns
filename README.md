# Lizzie Turney


Junior full-stack developer with an entrepreneurial flair for creating eye-catching applications! I'm best described as a bubbly, carbonara-lover, who never falters from being optimistic. Friends and colleagues consider me to be a very strong communicator (except when the term "groovy" occasionally slips out). I have experience in front-end, back-end, test-driven and database technologies. I lean towards front-end design due to the scope of creativity it allows. However, I enjoy every aspect of a full-stack code base and embrace every opportunity to improve my skills.

# Skills

**Communication:**

In my previous job, much of my time involved consulting with financial investors or investment managers over large amounts of money. This required a high-level of clarity and professionalism - something I can certainly bring to the table. Further to this, in sales, you learn to "mirror" your clients. Cold-calling and selling everyday, though immensely tough, taught me to tailor my approach to each individual, among other invaluable lessons. This stream of varied conversation was something I exceeded in, always hitting target and bringing in over £200k of revenue in my first year.

Technology is perhaps the most indispensable industry of our time. Therefore, being a strong communicator, someone to bridge the gap between client and developer, is perhaps more important than ever and will continue to be a growing necessity.

**Hard Worker:**

Jumping from a "C" to an "A" for A level French, exceeding my predicted grades, County Squash Champion and Grade 8 Voice were some early examples of my ability to work hard to achieve more. 

Self-sufficiency has always been important to me. I wanted to do Makers Academy for over a year and was able to save and complete the course, all while paying rent and bills in London without financial help. When I come across a problem in my code, you can guarantee I will solve it. I find great satisfaction in seeing my hard work pay off, and technology is no exception. As someone who has worked in industries such as film, sales and finance, I know versatility and a strong work ethic, are essential.

**Logical and Creative Thinker:**

When studying English Literature and Philosophy at University, one of the most useful subject matters was the study of Logic. This was actually my strongest course throughout my time at University. I received honours for every paper. Deducting the correct arguments came to me far more naturally than I ever suspected; I am able to revisit this part of my mind when I code. It has also benefited my creative side. In my masters, I had to edit, create and compose sound for trailers (the trailer I created here was for a 4 minute film https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sukp6BQ7_dQ).

I love to get creative, so being able to combine both my analytical and artistic brain caters perfectly! The easiest user experience is always the best, and I think both being creative and logical really helps here - the combination of the two enables me to problem-solve my way to wonderful, new products.
